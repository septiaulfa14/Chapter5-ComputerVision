# Chapter5-ComputerVision

### Task 1 : Digital Image Processing using OpenCV2
Implementation preprocessing digital image, for increase quality of image use method Pooling and CLAHE.

### Task 2 : Transfer Learning using Torchvision Pre-trained CNN Models
Implementation method Transfer Learning for Multi-Classification use Deep Learning-Based Computer Vision Model, like ResNet, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT)


### What To Do :
on Task 1, using a **Max Pooling, Min Pooling, and Average Pooling** operation. to replicate the concept (brighten dark-toned photos), and then compare the results with another approach, i.e., **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equation (CLAHE)**.

on Task 2, create machine learning using deep learning Convolutional Neural Network, predict image handwritting, from MNIST, and freeze layers on (1) "denseblock1", (2) "denseblock1" and "denseblock2", Retrain each model, plot its performance, and examine the difference. And Bonuses, replicate all of the steps above with different models, i.e., ResNet and ViT?
